# all_is_well
After watching a RyconRoleplays video, and hearing his request (whilst knowing of a potential solution), I took the liberty of making a simple hackjob mod to lift a feature from MSTExtra (namely the covered well/bucket-equipped well, and the bucket ofc) to neatly and cleanly slide it into Rycons game. Please note, I did not create this feature, I'm only transplanting it, if the creator wishes me to remove this, I'll happily do so (just as soon as I can find a way to reach out to ChaosVolt!)
===
Testing:  After creating a world with the same modlist as Rycon, I can safely say this mod should work without issue, as in a character with the tools/supplies can indeed create the wooden bucket, creat a well, and attach the bucket to the well with some cordage rope and other bits.
